		<div class="greetings"><strong>Dear Friend,</strong><br /><br />It’s no  news to you that writing ebooks is arguably one of the easiest and most flexible ways to earn a living in the world.<br /><br />In fact, if you have access to a computer and internet.<br /><br />(and I assume you do since you are reading this)<br /><br />you can write and make money from virtually anywhere<br /><br />The good thing is... I am about to show you exactly how, for free!<br /><br />(more about this in a second)<br /><br />But first you need to understand what the ebook and information marketing industry really are.<br /><br />Over the past decade, eBooks have grown to become one of the fastest rising industry on the planet. <br /><br />Let’s consider the following facts:</div>
		<div class="common_content">
			<div class="book_content">
				<div class="img_holder"><img src="images/book2.png" alt="" /></div>
				<div class="text_holder">
					<ul>
						<li>The eBook industry represents  a whopping $7 billion in yearly sales</li>
						<li>It accounts for 20% of the entire US consumer book industry</li>
						<li>By 2016 one out of every two books sold will be an eBook</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="publishing_market">
			The bottom line is...<br /><br /><span>Within the next <strong>5 years</strong><br />there will be more eBooks sold<br /><span class="book">&nbsp;</span> than physical books.</span>
		</div>
		<div class="center_image"><img src="images/img1.jpg" alt="" class="chart" /><br /><br />And that’s a <strong>massive</strong> shift.</div>
		<div class="ebook_revolution">Are You Going To Be Part<br />Of The eBook Revolution?</div>
		<div class="common_content">You see, so far most people have been doing it wrong all this while.<br /><br />For most internet marketers creating eBook that actually sell is still a major pain in the neck.<br /><br />You might have learnt about eBook marketing and created what you thought would be a killer product.<br /><br />You might even have made a few sales here and there from the WSO forum but nothing ground-breaking so far.<br /><br />But still, in the back of your head, a little voice keeps on telling you that there must be more to eBook marketing than meets the eyes.</div>
		<div class="ugly_dont_sell">The Truth Is...<br />“Ugly” Don’t Sell</div>
		<div class="common_content">Do you ever wonder how do the big boys really do it?<br /><br />You know the ones who are killing it online?<br /><br /><strong>Let me give you a hint.</strong><br /><br />First of all they provide awesome content to their readers.<br /><br />(This may sound very obvious but trust me when I say that a lot of people try to get away with below-average content)<br /><br />And besides providing incredible content, they know one simple truth:<br /><br />Beauty sells.</div>
		<div class="book_cover"><span>Here is an Example..</span><br /><br />Here Is How Tim Feriss<br />Branded His Last 3 Book Covers</div>
		<div class="center_image"><img src="images/img2.png" alt="" class="three_book" /><br /><br />You can clearly see how attractive and beautiful these covers area.<br /><strong>Now let’s compare these with your “average Joe marketer” eBook cover.</strong><br /><br /><img src="images/img3.png" class="single_book" alt="" /></div>
		<div class="common_content">Which of these two strategies do you think is going to get you more buyers, and therefore more profits?<br /><br />It’s pretty clear: branding your products can make or break your business.</div>
		<div class="extremely_difficult"><span>The only problem is...</span><br />Creating Alluring Graphics<br />Is Extremely Difficult.</div>
		<div class="common_content">Truth be told, designing these does take professional skills.<br /><br />First you need to figure out what best image ratio is (and trust me this is already no mean feat).<br /><br />Secondly you need to think about which are the best fonts for book covers and then find (hopefully not steal) background vector images and label graphics to make your product cover stand out.<br /><br />Finally you need to come up with gorgeous designs that can draw visitors to buy to your eBook and trust your brand.<br /><br />But don’t even think about using Paint to do these...<br /><br />You can try with Gimp if you are one of the braves...<br /><br />but to be honest I wouldn’t even recommend these sub-par solutions to my worst enemy.<br /><br />Truth is...</div>
		<div class="tagline">You Don’t Have The <strong>Money</strong> To Buy Photoshop,<br />You Don’t Have The <strong>Skills</strong> To Use It Yet And You<br />Don’t Have The <strong>Time</strong> To Master The Skills.</div>
		<div class="common_content">So what do you do?<br /><br />You might try to hire a “eBook cover designer” on Fiverr...<br /><br />... but I can safely bet you’ll be handed yet another templete, your cover will look cheap and you will likely be fed up with “outsourcing”.<br />Or you might even try to find a professional designer...<br /><br />But who wants to shell out $99 for a single BASIC eBook cover design?</div>
		<div class="center_image"><img src="images/img4.png" alt="" /><br /><strong>Designers usually charge a minimum of $99 for a simple eBook cover design</strong></div>
